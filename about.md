# About

I was drowning in a sea of bookmarked browser folders and rogue links taking over my screen like unruly squatters.

Then I thought, <i>"Stop wrangling with these wild links! Why not, just heard them all into one place?"</i>.

Now, all my profile links are in one place, No more bookmark battles just space for the important stuff - like cat videos and recipes Iâ€™ll never cook.

## Is this Free?
* 100% Free, Open Source and you'll never be charged
* For me, I needed something - so I created it!
* Personally I don't like having multiple folders for frequently used links
* I wanted something that could have different links for different browser profiles (personal vs business)

## Want to say Thank You?
Sure, just a <i>"Thank You"</i> would be nice! (No need to send money or buy coffee).

Send me a <a href="http://x.com/share?text=Thanks%21&hashtags=ProfileJumper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanks! on X</a> with the hashtag #ProfileJumper (or any other choice words) - this would make me most happy and grateful.

Knowing that someone else finds this useful is happiness squared.

## Privacy
Just a word on privacy, no personal data, links or anything else is captured or recorded. Even my ex couldn't spy on you with this!

This too is confirmed on the Chrome Web Store (see Privacy sections).
