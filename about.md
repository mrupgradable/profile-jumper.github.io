# About

I was drowning in a sea of bookmarked browser folders and rogue links taking over my screen like unruly squatters. <br/>
Then I thought, <i>"Stop wrangling with these wild links! Why not, just heard them all into one place?"</i>.<br/>
Now, all my profile links are in one place, No more bookmark battles just space for the important stuff - like cat videos and recipes Iâ€™ll never cook.

## Is this Free?
* Free, Open Source and you'll never be charged ðŸ’¯
* I needed something - so I created it!
* Personally I don't like having multiple folders for frequently used links
* I wanted something that could have different links for different browser profiles (personal vs work)

## Want to say Thank You?
Sure, just a <i>"Thank You"</i> would be nice! (No need to send money or buy coffee).

Send me a <a href="http://x.com/share?text=Thanks%21&hashtags=ProfileJumper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanks! on X</a> with the hashtag #ProfileJumper (or any other choice words) - this would make me most happy and grateful.<br/>
Knowing that someone else finds this useful is happiness squared.

## Privacy
Just a word on privacy, for the browser extension; none of your personal data, your profile links or anything else is captured or recorded. Even my ex couldn't spy on you with this!<br/>
This too is confirmed on the Chrome Web Store (see Privacy sections).<br/>
However, I do monitor inbound links to this website so that I can improve information provided here.
