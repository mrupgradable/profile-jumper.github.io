# About

I was drowning in a sea of bookmarked browser folders and rogue links taking over my screen like unruly squatters.

Then I thought, <i>"Stop wrangling with these wild links & why not, just heard them all into one place?"</i>.

Now, all my profile links <i>are</i> in one place, No more bookmark battles just space for the important stuff - like cat videos and recipes Iâ€™ll never cook.

## Go from this, to this!

<section class="compare">
    <p>Instead of having all profile links in a bookmark folder - have these frequently used profile links in one place.</p>

    <div class="before-and-after">
        <div class="before">
            <img src="{{ '/assets/image/compare/browser-links-in-bookmark-folder.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Bookmarks in browser folders">
        </div>
        <div class="after">
            <img src="{{ '/assets/image/compare/profile-links-from-bookmark-folder.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Profile Links from bookmark folder">
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="compare">
    <p>You could have all your profile links as bookmarks, but as you can see all these links (even if icons) take up space. Space that could be used for other bookmarks. Again have these all in one place.</p>

    <div class="before-and-after">
        <div class="before">
            <img src="{{ '/assets/image/compare/browser-links-as-bookmarks.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Browser links as bookmarks">
        </div>
        <div class="after">
            <img src="{{ '/assets/image/compare/profile-links-from-bookmarks.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Profile Links from bookmarks">
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
