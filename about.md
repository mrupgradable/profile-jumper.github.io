# About

I was drowning in a sea of bookmarked browser folders and rogue links taking over my screen like unruly squatters.

Then I thought, <i>"Stop wrangling with these wild links & why not, just heard them all into one place?"</i>.

Now, all my profile links <i>are</i> in one place, No more bookmark battles just space for the important stuff - like cat videos and recipes Iâ€™ll never cook.
